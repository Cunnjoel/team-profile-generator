# team-profile-generator-homework

Wrote test code for 4 roles.
Used written code to write js code using classes.
3 classes were used as sub classes to extend the initial.

Classes used to create HTML for a team profile generator.

"Code does not collect data for test or when script is initiated, all returns are undefined.
I plan on getting further help in office hours and a tutor to help find and understand the issues."
